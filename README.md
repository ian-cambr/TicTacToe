# Objectives
The goal for this project was to show off the Minimax algorithm in actual play! The AI should play a pretty decent game of Tic Tac Toe at depth 3, and a perfect game at depth 9.
I wanted to write this in a heavily-OOP fashion, and it was my first attempt at an engine. If I were to revisit or rewrite this project, I would use bitboards and a hashing algorithm.

# Other
Thanks for checking out my code. I'll note that this was an individually-assigned school project; usually I commit more often. :)
Output was tested against a sample to verify its correctness.
